Notes:

####NOTE 1

Events Goer can be reset by deleting contents of tmp-storage

Change storage from file-based to memory based by changing conductor file (*.toml)
[instances.storage]
type = "file"
path= "tmp-storage"

to
[instances.storage]
type = "memory"

###################

####NOTE 2
Logger has name-space handles for easy filtering, which can be edited in the *.toml

debug/net/handle is very noisy
###################

####NOTE 3
Zomes unit of composability, derived from "chromosomes"
Each zome compiles to its own WebAssembly
###################

####NOTE 4
Nothing is ever deleted from the chain
The chain is an append-only sequence
There is pseudo-update and delete
###################

####NOTE 5
lib.rs has "define_zome!", a macro that defines the zome, relies on hdk imports. Each zome has functions and traits. Each function has input, outputs, and handlers.

####NOTE 6
https://developer.holochain.org
Guidebook covers wide range of topics
API covers hdk
	define_zome! macro
	commit_entry
	delete_entry
	update_entry
	get_entry

####NOTE 7
User interfaces (web front-end) developed in React
For now, hApps only in Rust because the HDK is in Rust (and Rust is a language that is JSON serializable/parseable into WebAssembly)

Questions
The tmp storage for Events Goer which consists of easily viewable files, when the app gets deployed, will tmp storage look the same in other agents' copy?
Alternatively, what gets copied?
