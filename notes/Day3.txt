NOTES
The expected hash value QmbL7tDsQumvsUTDVZo5mtJknhV6bT28yZDuTdyHQdfqTs
depends on struct member names ("name"), entry! name ("person").


QUESTIONS

Why does an entry need to have a struct as native_type?
	Why can't we put type String instead of Person?

Where would you see the error string message from the zome entry's validation code?

Why did I need a different return type for link_entries?
	hdk::link_entries

Why is link's tag not enforced by link_entries?
	It is "enforced" by get_links:
    × should be equivalent
    -----------------------
      operator: deepEqual
      expected: |-
        { Ok: { addresses: [ 'QmPcNictUVyk9tki1TwnsZ2RzzuPYdNPoFXZReRQLUJb4X' ] } }
      actual: |-
        { Ok: { addresses: [] } }
