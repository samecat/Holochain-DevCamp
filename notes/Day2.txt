INSTANCE = AGENT + DNA

Exclamation mark = Rust Macro

To commit an entry, you need to define an entry type

Entries can be Public or Private (shared or not shared to DHT)
	Right now, only Public is supported
	
Ok(()) in validation call-back just lets anything be valid

cas is short for content-addressable storage
	two pieces of data that are the same don't take up twice the amount of storage
	they take up only one, because when hashed, they have the same address
	Address is the resulting hash of the entry and its address in the chain and DHT, where it can be retrieved from
	
.into() is for type conversion

Visual Studio Code and RLS (rust lang extension)

& means reference, so if in function signature, then pass argument with ampersand

You can daisy function return values in Rust by leaving out the semi-colon for the function call.

Traits need to expose function calls via hc_public

Scenarios work independently with their own instantiation of the DNA
	i.e. data from one scenario does not carry over to another scenario
	
QUESTIONS
1. Syntax questions? 
	What is Rust syntax and what is holochain syntax?
	Zome macro, simplest zome, why are some things delimited by square brackets and others by curly
2. Should we run npm audit when this message comes up?
found 63 low severity vulnerabilities
  run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details

	
FEEDBACK
The two items of Day2 point to the same Medium article; a bit confusing
